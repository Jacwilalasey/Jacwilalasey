- 👋 Hi, I’m @Jacwilalasey
- 👀 I’m interested in web3, currently running my very own metaverse project based upon NFT Worlds IP. I am also a keen gamer and love a bit of skateboarding when I have the free time. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning front-end dev, with an aim to migrate from traditional ops and process work into a more dynamic web and/or software development role in the next couple of years.
- 💞️ I’m always open to collaborate on anything web3, but also open to chatting and working together on anything front-end, as i'd love to improve my knowledge and support growing projects.
- 📫 You can reach me through GH or Twitter, both linked in my profile.
